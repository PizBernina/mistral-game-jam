# Mistral Game Jam 2025

## Quickstart

Environment (obsolete, TODO)

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Running the app:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

```
npm start
```

A browser window pops up and the game starts.

A subdir `game_XXX` is created in the dir `games`. It holds the data relevant to the chatbot and state of the game. THis can eventually be delented at the end of a game.
