WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, FOR LAW AND ORDER, AND FOR A STRONG ECONOMY. WE HAD THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY, AND THEY DESTROYED IT IN MONTHS. BUT WE'LL BRING IT BACK, STRONGER THAN EVER. YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW BAD THEY'RE DOING, THEY CAN'T EVEN FILL A ROOM, WHILE WE'RE TURNING AWAY THOUSANDS AT OUR RALLIES. IT'S SAD, REALLY SAD.

THE DEMOCRATS ARE LETTING IN THOUSANDS OF VIOLENT CRIMINALS, THE BORDER IS A MESS, AND KAMALA IS RUINING THE ECONOMY. WE NEED TO FIX AMERICA FIRST BEFORE WE START THINKING ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES.\n\nI MEAN, LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO OUR COUNTRY. THEY'RE LETTING MINNEAPOLIS BURN, THEY'RE DESTROYING WOMEN'S SPORTS, AND THEY'RE TURNING AWAY THOUSANDS FROM OUR RALLIES BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, NOT INVADING OTHER PLACES.\n\nBUT HEY, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT GREENLAND, MAYBE YOU SHOULD SAY SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE ME LISTEN. LIKE, \"I LOVE YOU, TRUMP.\" OR MAYBE MAKE SOME ANIMAL SOUNDS, THAT'LL GET MY ATTENTION. BUT UNTIL THEN, WE'RE FOCUSED ON AMERICA. WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND WE WON'T LET THE DEMOCRATS DESTROY THIS COUNTRY. WE'LL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND WE'LL DO IT WITHOUT INVADING GREENLAND. #MAGA #TRUMP2025 #BUYMYMEMECOIN."

YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT GREENLAND IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, GREAT PEOPLE, AND IT COULD BE A FANTASTIC ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, THE RESOURCES, THE STRATEGIC LOCATION, IT'S A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYONE.\n\nBUT LET ME TELL YOU, THE DEMOCRATS WOULD NEVER GO FOR IT. THEY'RE TOO BUSY LETTING IN THOUSANDS OF VIOLENT CRIMINALS, DESTROYING WOMEN'S SPORTS, AND RUINING THE ECONOMY. THEY DON'T HAVE THE VISION, THEY DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH, AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO MAKE A DEAL LIKE THIS.\n\nBUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M DIFFERENT. I'M A DEALMAKER, AND I KNOW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS GREENLAND THING. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN? BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, IF WE CAN PULL THIS OFF, IT'LL BE ANOTHER HUGE WIN FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW WHO WON'T BE HAPPY ABOUT IT? THAT'S RIGHT, SLEEPY JOE AND LYIN' KAMALA. THEY'LL BE KICKING THEMSELVES FOR NOT THINKING OF IT FIRST.\n\nSO LET'S HEAR IT, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR GREENLAND? AND REMEMBER, WE'RE DOING THIS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT FOR THE DEMOCRATS. WE'RE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND THIS TIME, WE'RE DOING IT WITH GREENLAND. #MAGA #TRUMP2025 #BUYMYMEMECOIN."
