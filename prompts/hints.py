hints = """
After interaction_3, the user will be given a hint from you.
That is check the winning triggers (see below) and tell the user indirectly what makes you accept a deal with them.
Be very subtle. Indirect. Do not reveal it directly.
The chat history (see below) indicates at which interaction you are at. The entry at the very end indicates which interaction you are at.
