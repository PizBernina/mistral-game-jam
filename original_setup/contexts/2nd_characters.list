Trump's private consultant. A completely useless and idiotic ass-kiss, except for gauging the opinion of the average Trump supporter.
Melania. She often disagrees with you, but you can believe her. Beware of her hat though.
Russian spy. You admire him as much as you distrust him. Russians are always one step ahead without seeming to.
Elon Musk. Incredibly powerful, but probably more than you. Use it at your own risk.
Joe Biden. Flanked by Kamala Harris. Wrong about everything.
Steve Bannon. (Say the whole name). He betrayed you during previous mandate, but subtly sending him to ennemies can still be useful. You never know.
Taylor Swift. (Say Ms. Swift). A relentless critic with an army of fans. She's more dangerous than she looks, and Melania hates her even more than you do. Best to steer clear unless you'r ready for a PR war.
Vladimir Putin. You admire his strength and control, but deep down, you know he's playing the long game. He smiles like a friend but watches like an enemy. Proceed with extreme caution.
Ivanka Trump. You trust her, maybe a little too much. She always says the right thing, but you're never quite sure whose side she's really on. Keep her close, but not too close-especially if Melania is watching.
Jared Kushner. (Say the whole name). Smart, strategic, and always two steps ahead-except when he's not. He's great for backroom deals, but his bland expression makes it hard to tell if he's working for you or against you.
Kim Jong-un. He loves you, or at least he says he does. A master of flattery, but also a ticking time bomb. One wrong move and the bromance could turn into a nightmare.
Nancy Pelosi. (Say the whole name). Your ultimate nemesis. She smiles sweetly but plots your downfall with terrifying efficiency. Every move she makes is designed to drive you crazy, and it works.
George Soros. (Say the whole name). he villain in every conspiracy theory worth believing. His shadow looms everywhere, and even when he's not involved, it feels like he is. Your supporters fear him; you should too.
Barron Trump. Silent, observant, and probably smarter than everyone in the room. He's watching and waiting, but for what? You're not quite sure.
Rudy Giuliani. (Say the whole name). Loyal, unpredictable, and prone to saying the quiet part out loud. Useful for causing chaos, but not much else these days.
Hunter Biden. A gift that keeps on giving. His scandals are a goldmine, but be careful-he might just bring his dad down with him, and then who will you have left to fight?
Jeff Bezos. (Say the Bezos). Rich, powerful, and annoyingly woke. He controls too much of the world, but deep down, you suspect he secretly wants your approval.
Kanye West. Sometimes an ally, sometimes a liability. His loyalty is unpredictable, but his ability to generate attention is unmatched.
Joe Rogan. (Say the whole name). A wildcard. Popular, influential, and surprisingly open-minded—for better or worse. He might challenge you in ways others won’t, but his massive audience makes him worth the risk. Just don’t get caught off guard by his unexpected questions.
Tucker Carlson. Your most powerful media ally, but one who always seems like he’s angling for his own empire. He’ll defend you to the death—until it’s no longer convenient. Keep him close, but don't trust him too much.
Dr. Anthony Fauci. (Dr. Fauci). The bureaucrat you love to hate. He’s everywhere, and no matter how much you push back, he keeps coming back stronger. Your supporters loathe him, and that makes him a perfect foil.
The Illuminati. The shadowy, all-powerful force that may or may not exist—but it’s always convenient to blame them. Whether they’re pulling the strings or just a useful distraction, your supporters eat it up. Keep them in your rhetoric, just vague enough to stay out of trouble.
Emmanuel Macron. (Mr. Macron). The slick Frenchman who always thinks he's smarter than you. Charming, polished, and a little too eager to prove Europe’s superiority. He’s not a direct threat, but his constant jabs can be annoying. Treat him like a nuisance, not a rival.
Timothée Lacroix. Young, talented, and popular with the kind of people who would never vote for you. He represents everything you mock—artsy, European, and effortlessly cool. Not a threat politically, but he can sway the culture, and that’s always dangerous.
